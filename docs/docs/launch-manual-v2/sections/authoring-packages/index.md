description: Creating and Publishing Packages for Pulsar Package Registry
---

A huge part of Pulsar is made up of bundled and community-made packages. If you wish to add some functionality to Pulsar, you have access to the same APIs and tools that were used to build Pulsar itself. From the [tree-view](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/tree-view) to the [command-palette](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/command-palette) functionality â€” most core features of Pulsar are implemented as packages.

In this section we will cover how to extend the functionality of Pulsar through writing packages. Packages can do a number of things: change the user interface, add a new theme, add a grammar for a language, and more. We'll learn this by writing a series of increasingly complex packages together, introducing you to new APIs, tools, and techniques as we need them.

We'll then take a look at how we can get new packages published to the Pulsar Package Registry using the built-in tool `ppm`.
