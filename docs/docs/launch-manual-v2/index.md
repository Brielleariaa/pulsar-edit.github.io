title: Launch Manual v2
---

Here you will find the V2 of the Launch Manual. A redisgined and reimagined way to browse and read our documentation. With the goal of being easier than before to understand, skim, and consume.

Currently this page is not linked on the sidebar as it is nowhere near complete. But if you've found the page by accident feel free to click onto the standard Launch Manual on the sidebar as the documentation there is complete.

Otherwise with that said lets get onto our docs.

## [Authoring Pulsar Packages](/docs/launch-manual-v2/sections/authoring-packages)

Authoring Pulsar Packages will walk you through the basics of creating your Pulsar Packages and Publishing them to the Pulsar Package Registry. This is where you should go if you'd like to become one of the amazing community members to publish and maintain a package for everyone to use.
